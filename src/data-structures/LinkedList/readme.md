# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure. Linked list is a good choice over arrays when you don't need to have random/indexed access to your data, and when you want to have efficient insertion or deletion of elements in the beginning or in the middle of a list.

Inside the linked list each element is stored in a form of Node. Node is made up of two items: data and a reference/pointer to another node.

Grouping Nodes together we can make a linked list. Each of the elements will keep data and a reference/pointer to the next node. The entry point into a linked list is called the **Head** of the list (it's the first node of the list). The last Node in a linked list is called the **Tail.**
